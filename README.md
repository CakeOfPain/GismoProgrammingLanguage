<center><h1>Gismo Programming Language</h1></center>

[Try It Out Here (Webdemo)](https://gismo-online-compiler.pages.dev/Try)


This is the repository for the **Gismo Programming Language**‚Äîa meta-programming language that allows you to extend its syntax and functionality as needed. Gismo combines the extensibility of Lisp with a C-like syntax, making it both powerful and familiar.

---

## üöÄ Overview

Gismo is designed for meta-programming, enabling developers to create and extend the language with new syntaxes and constructs. Instead of a traditional compiler, Gismo uses an **Interpiler**‚Äîa hybrid of an interpreter and a compiler‚Äîthat can be programmed to generate code for any backend.

### Key Concepts

- **Extensible Syntax**: Define or overload operators and create new language constructs.
- **Interpiler Architecture**: Program the interpiler to generate code, offering flexibility in code generation.
- **Lisp-like Meta-Programming**: Achieve powerful meta-programming capabilities similar to Lisp but with a C-like syntax.
- **Operator Overloading & Type System**: Utilize advanced features to customize language behavior.

---

## üë• Target Audience

Gismo is ideal for:

- **Hobbyists and Researchers**: Interested in creating custom dialects and experimenting with language design.
- **Meta-Programmers**: Developers who want to extend the language capabilities to suit specific needs.
- **General Programmers**: Once a dialect is established, Gismo can be used by anyone for various programming tasks.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Customizable Code Generators**: Write different code generators to compile to any backend.
- **Define New Operators**: Use the `::=` syntax to define or overload operators.
- **Inbuilt Functions for Language Extension**: Use functions prefixed with `$` to extend the language.

#### Example: Defining a New Operator

```fsharp
int + int ::= $ADD($1, $2)
```

This snippet tells the interpiler to translate every `+` operation between two integers into `$ADD($1, $2)`, where `$1` and `$2` are placeholders for the operands.

---

## üìù "Hello, World!" Example

While there's no traditional "Hello, World!" in Gismo, you can make the interpiler output "Hello, World!" at compile time using the `$PRINTLN` inbuilt function:

```fsharp
$PRINTLN("Hello, World!")
```

## üîß Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Go Language**: Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) installed on your system.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CakeOfPain/GismoProgrammingLanguage.git
   cd gismo
   ```

2. **Build the Interpiler**

   ```bash
   go build -o compiler
   ```

3. **Run a Gismo Program**

   ```bash
   ./compiler [path to your Gismo file]
   ```

---

## üåü Getting Started

Create a file named `example.gsm`:

```fsharp
int + int ::= $ADD($1, $2)
$PRINTLN("Extending Gismo!")
```

Run the interpiler:

```bash
./compiler example.gsm
```

---

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

Future plans for Gismo include:

- **Standard Library Development**: Building a comprehensive standard library.
- **Enhanced Backend Support**: Extending code generation to more backends.
- **IDE Integration**: Developing plugins for popular IDEs.
- **Debugger Tools**: Implementing debugging tools tailored for meta-programming.
- **Community Dialects**: Encouraging the creation of dialects with their own standard libraries.

---
